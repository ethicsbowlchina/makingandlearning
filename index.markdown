# About the course

Educational policy makers have taken note of the phenomenon, and are now investing heavily in projects that attempt to harness this grassroots movement and connect it to STEM and STEAM education, workforce preparedness, and the development of innovative and entrepreneurial skills.

The goal of Making+Learning is to build the capacity of libraries and museums to create and sustain effective makerspaces and related programs for learning within and outside of their own organizations.
