# Framing

In this activity, the participants will consider various facets of their program on a spectrum. The participants will first use the tool to assess where they are for certain spectra. They will make a mark of where they think they are (or aim to be) with respect to the different spectra. Rather than looking for similarities, the discussion can center on where they notice significant differences in perspective from the same team (e.g. one person thinks their activities are characterized as open ended while another person thinks their activities are characterized as close ended). The spectra will also be written on big pieces of flip chart paper around the room. After the participants make their marks on their own sheet, they can take a circular sticker and place it on the spectra written on the flip chart paper. This will show the variation of sites represented at the workshop. Then, the participants will discuss where they placed themselves on the spectra.
