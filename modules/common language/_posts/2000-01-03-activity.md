# Activity

- Introduction: the purpose of this activity is to develop common language across team members related to important components. This tool can also be a starting point for action. 
- Participants will first assess where they are on the five elements. This will be done individually (see Program Variations)
- Participants will place themselves on spectra that are posted on the wall.
- Participants within a team will share where their responses: Where were they similar? Where were they different? If someone is solo, they will be working with another solo person or group. 
- Discuss as a whole group: What do you notice about the group responses? What did you notice from your conversations within your team?

As an extension activity, participants can play with 2x2 spectra. This means they can intersect two different spectra whose intersection is meaningful for understanding their space (imagine open-ended â€“ close-ended on the x-axis and high/low facilitation as the y-axis). 

- Have the participants complete 3 2x2 spectra.
- Go back to your group and sketch out 2 or 3 spectra that represent important intersections for your space.
- Identify additional spectra that might be relevant to your space.
- Share additional spectra or 2x2s.
- Discuss the value of the activity.
