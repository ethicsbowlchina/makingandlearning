We believe that community forms an essential part of learning. Not only does being part of a community help motivate you, but learning to work together and improving how you communicate are useful skill to learn on their own.

The aim of this module is to

- understand more about why community is important for online learning.
- find a community to build your course with.
- decide what the community in your course will look like.
- build on-ramps for learners to join your community.
