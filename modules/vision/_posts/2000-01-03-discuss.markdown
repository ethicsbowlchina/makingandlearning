# Organize a hangout

Organize your very own hangout! Post the date and time that you want to hold the hangout on [here on discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/c/course-in-a-box/hangouts) and you can use [this link](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to hang out. When people go to that link, they will automatically join the same Google Hangout!

To get the conversation started, let everyone share their hobby. Then ask everyone to find an online community for someone else's hobby.
