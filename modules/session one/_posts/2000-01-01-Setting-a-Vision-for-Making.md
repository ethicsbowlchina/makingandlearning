## Session 1: Setting a Vision for Making 

Download and print out the [Vision Statement Tool](https://github.com/p2pu/makingandlearning/raw/gh-pages/modules/tools/Vision-Statement-Tool.pdf), and watch these brief videos before reading through the activity. 

#### Framing

The goal of this activity is to create a succinct vision statement for your makerspace. The vision statement tool enables participants to form something akin to an “elevator pitch.” Therefore, try to identify an audience (the person stuck in the elevator with you). Is it a parent? Community member? Board member? Manager? You don't have to finalize your maker-based vision statement right now; the activity is intended to help you take the first important steps to forming a single statement that reflects many of the core priorities for your makerspace or maker programs.
