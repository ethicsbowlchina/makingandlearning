Web + content = free education for all! Well, almost. The popular argument of how technology will disrupt education is typically based on the idea that low cost distribution of hight quality content will result in free (almost) education for everyone. While high quality content doesn't hurt, it's not the whole story. 

There are lots of research showing that learners (even those in brick and mortar institutions) are more likely to succeed when working on projects about topics they value. 

The aim of this module is to

- identify the key questions in your target community
- define the learning outcomes for your course
- design good assignments for your course that engage learners
