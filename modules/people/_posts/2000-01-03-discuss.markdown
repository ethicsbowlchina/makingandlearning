# Organize a hangout

Organize your very own hangout! Post the date and time that you want to hold the hangout on [here on discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/c/course-in-a-box/hangouts) and you can use [this link](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to hang out. When people go to that link, they will automatically join the same Google Hangout!

This is a good opportunity to ask other people to suggest resources that they think will be useful for someone doing your course.
